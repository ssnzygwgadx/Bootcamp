# Loops Exercise

1. Create a dictionary with five programming concepts you have learnt from the previous notebooks as the keys and the definition of that concept as its value.
2. Using a for loop iterate over the dictionary you created and utilise an f-string to print a message using the key and value of each item in your dictionary.
3. Combine the `input()` function and a while loop to prompt the user to input a name that is added to a list called `names` until there are ten names in the list.
4. Use a list comprehension to make a list of numbers ranging from 1 - 100.
5. Use another list comprehension to make a list of numbers in the previously created list that are wholly divisible by 7.
